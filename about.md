# Personal life

I was born in New York City and moved to Egypt when I was very young, where I lived until the end of high school. I then moved to Switzerland at 18 to pursue my education.

Maths and Science have always intrigued me, so becoming an engineer was a natural decision as I have always
been fascinated as to how things work. 

I played all kinds of sports from a very young age, whether it's football (soccer at some might say :) ), squash, track and field, you name it! I also recently developed a passion for padel/pickleball. 

# Education

After graduating secondary school with a French Baccalaur√©at with a scientific orientation in 2016,
I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Microengineering in 2020, and then a Master's Degree in Robotics and Data Science in 2023 at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/" target="_blank">EPFL</a> in Lausanne, Switzerland. As part of that curriculum, I completed my Master's Thesis in underwater robotics at the the <a href="https://www.micro.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory</a> in Cambridge, MA.

Microengineering at EPFL allowed me to develop skills in a lot of domains such as electrical engineering,
mechanical design, structural engineering, micro/nano-tech, software engineering and robotics. It was during my final
year and various internships that I developed a keen interest in Machine Learning Engineering, where I developed skills in data analysis, multimodal/multisensor models, AWS, Docker, and more.
